SCAssessmentTool measures how difficult it is to manage the network due to the number of elements and their interconnections. It is typically split into horizontal complexity (breadth of the network at each stage) and vertical complexity (depth or number of tiers).

1. Horizontal Complexity
Definition: The number of parallel entities (e.g., suppliers, products, facilities, or customers) at the same tier/level in the supply chain.
Why it matters: High horizontal complexity increases coordination effort, inventory needs, and risk of disruptions.

2. Vertical Complexity
Definition: The number of sequential tiers/layers from raw materials to end customer.
Why it matters: Deeper chains amplify lead times, bullwhip effects, and visibility challenges.
